We submitted this project to Cathacks.

## Inspiration
This week, our team decided to just have fun while being nostalgic building an old game, Pong is something that comes to our mind, so here we go!

## What it does
Cyberponk is a cyberpunk-themed pong game. Our inspiration came from the theme of Cathacks this year "Cyberpunk".

## How I built it
Primarily we used Unity to build the entire game and interactions. For visuals, we use Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Canva for the animation.

## Challenges I ran into
It's our second time building a game from scratch by using Unity. So it takes quite a long time for us trying to figure things out from tutorials (have to admit this is not so easy at all). Red sign errors everywhere :(

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We successfully build the game in a short amount of time with good visuals and user experience, really so happy!

## What I learned
The hardest part in creating a game is the interaction and visual part. Each of the movements needs to make a sure match with the visual. And combine that with coding skills so the interaction can work as we expected. After all, we have a lot of fun this weekend!

## What's next
Online multiplayer match and VR mode.
